What are your opinions on Agile software development?
My view of Agile software development was heavily shaped by my experiences and learning from mentors like Forrest Chang. 
Agile's adaptability, iterative progress and emphasis on collaboration closely align with my own experiences in software
development, especially in team projects at the Turing School. I value Agile for its ability to efficiently address client
needs and facilitate continuous improvement in the development process. 

TDD or BDD?
From my experience, I've mostly done TDD at the Turing School. We'd write the RSpec spec tests first that detail the logic/data flow 
and then move on to implementation. Sometimes, these tests can be difficult to write so it may be more time efficient to start with BDD.
However, no matter what there should be a test for every function and piece of logic added. I use SimpleCov to get a quick snapshot of
the test coverage extent. 

What are you looking for in a job?
In my pursuit of a career in software engineering, I am looking for a role where I can continue to grow as a software craftsman, embracing
the values of quality, continuous learning, and teamwork. My experiences have underscored the importance of mentorship, collaboration, 
and a commitment to excellence. I am eager to join a team like Hedgeye where I can contribute my skills in Ruby and web development while
also growing in an environment that values technical excellence, personal development, and a collaborative culture.
